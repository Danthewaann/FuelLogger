### FuelLogger
Command line interface program that manages fuel transactions for a single vehicle

The program allows you to add a new fill-up, where you provide info like:
1. Date of fill-up
2. Current car mileage
3. Amount of fuel purchased and;
4. Cost per litre of fuel

The program also generates different types of reports of fuel transactions made between two supplied dates:
1. Reports fuel quantity bought between two dates
2. Reports total cost of fuel bought between two dates and;
3. Reports a list of transactions made between two dates

This was a project I did for an assignment at university, and I thought I might as well share it here
